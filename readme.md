* d3d11.dll
* ddraw.dll
* dinput.dll
* dinput8.dll (x86 and x64)

* msvfw32.dll
* vorbisFile.dll
* winmmbase.dll
* xlive.dll

------------------------
In order to install it, you just need to place DLL into game directory. Usually it works as dinput8.dll, but if it's not, there is a possibility to rename it(see the list of supported names above).


USAGE
------------------------
Put DLL files in 'scripts' or 'plugins' folder.


ADDITIONAL WINDOWED MODE FEATURE
------------------------
ASI loader have built-in wndmode.dll, which can be loaded, if you create empty wndmode.ini in the folder with asi loader's dll. It will be automatically filled with example configuration at the first run of the game. Settings are not universal and should be changed in every specific case.

D3D8TO9
------------------------
Some mods, like ![skygfx](https://github.com/aap/skygfx_vc) require ![d3d8to9](https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9). It is also a part of ASI loader, so in order to use it, create global.ini inside scripts folder with the following content:
```
[GlobalSets]
UseD3D8to9=1
```

![See example of global.ini here](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/blob/master/data/scripts/global.ini).
